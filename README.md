## Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction App is designed to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features. The project leverages machine learning models to analyze customer data and provides a robust solution for businesses to anticipate customer behavior, allowing for proactive retention strategies.

This repository includes all the necessary scripts, models, and documentation to run, and extend the churn prediction pipeline.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline:** Handles missing data, feature scaling, encoding, and more.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** Includes RandomForest, XGBoost, SVM and KNN models.
- **Pipeline Persistence:** Save and load pipelines with models for easy deployment.
- **AUC Evaluation:** All models are evaluated using the AUC metric to ensure performance is consistent and measurable.
- **Integration with Git:** Properly configured to handle large model files using Git LFS.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each customer (dropped during preprocessing)
- `REGION`: Categorical feature representing customer's region
- `TENURE`: Numeric feature representing the length of time the customer has been with the service
- `MONTANT`: Numeric feature representing the monetary amount spent by the customer
- `FREQUENCE_RECH`: Numeric feature representing the frequency of recharges
- `REVENUE`: Numeric feature representing the revenue generated by the customer
- `ARPU_SEGMENT`: Numeric feature related to the customer's average revenue per user
- `FREQUENCE`: Numeric feature representing general frequency of interaction
- `DATA_VOLUME`: Numeric feature representing the data usage volume
- `ON_NET`, `ORANGE`, `TIGO`, `ZONE1`, `ZONE2`: Categorical features related to network usage
- `MRG`: Categorical feature representing margin
- `REGULARITY`: Categorical feature representing customer regularity, segmented into `low` and `high`
- `TOP_PACK`: Categorical feature representing the top package used by the customer
- `FREQ_TOP_PACK`: Numeric feature related to frequency of top package usage
- `CHURN`: Target variable, indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)

```

## Usage

### Running the App

The application will be run locally using streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the Streamlit server, and you can interact with the customer churn prediction models through a web interface.

### Predicting Churn

To make predictions, use the provided interface to input customer data, and the app will display the probability of churn using the best-performing model.


## Modeling

The project includes several machine learning models, with a focus on handling class imbalance, high variability, and skewed distributions. The following models are implemented:

- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **SVMClassifier**
- **XGBClassifier**
- **KNNClassifier**

Each model is trained with a preprocessing pipeline that handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features. The best-performing model is selected based on the AUC score.


## Model Evaluation

All models are evaluated using the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric. The AUC score provides a robust measure of model performance, especially in scenarios with class imbalance.


## Streamlit Integration

This repository now includes a Streamlit app that allows you to interactively explore the customer churn prediction models. 

### How to Run the Streamlit App

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. The app will be available in your web browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```
